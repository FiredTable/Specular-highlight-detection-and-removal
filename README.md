# Specular-highlight-detection-and-removal
## Full polarization images dataset for highly reflective workpieces
According to the quarter-waveplate rotation method introduced, we collected polarization images dataset of different industrial scenes under various illumination environments, to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Defects such as scratches or pits exist on the surface of these workpieces. In the experiments, natural light sources and polarized light sources are mixed to simulate a complex industrial inspection illumination environment. At this time, there are multiple areas of specular reflection on workpiece surface, and simply rotating the quarter-wave plate cannot completely eliminate specular highlight. We employ the self-developed polarization imaging system to acquire polarization images. The system features a linear polarizer with a fixed orientation, while the quarter-waveplate rotates in 10° increments from 0° to 180°, leading to the acquisition of 19 polarization images. We collected a total of 608 images captured on 32 different scenes; the size of the images is $1224 \times 1024$.
